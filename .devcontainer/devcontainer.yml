# Codespaces setup for Titanic Dashboard
# This file enables Docker Compose in Codespaces

version: 1.0

services:
  app:
    # Just a placeholder, main entry is docker-compose.yml
    command: sleep infinity
    # Optionally, you can expose ports here if you want Codespaces to show them
    # ports:
    #   - 80:80

# Codespaces will use docker-compose.yml in the repo to start all services
# After Codespace is created, run:
#   bash start-all.sh
# Or manually: npm install, npm run build, docker-compose up --build

# You can preview the app at http://localhost:80 in Codespaces
